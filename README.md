# Why

> `Q`: Another programming language... Why?

> `A`: Why not?

## Status

The language is hardly in its infancy, and as such I cannot recommend
it for use.

See the [ideas](https://github.com/Jonxslays/why/tree/master/ideas)
directory for my vision of the language.

## Implementation

I started implementing this language in [C](https://www.cprogramming.com/),
with plans to fall back to [Python](https://www.python.org/) when I failed.
Instead, I did ok and was able to lex some tokens successfully.

It was clear though, that [C](https://www.cprogramming.com/)'s archaic
style was going to lead me down a dark path.

Enter [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a fast compiled language with
modern features and amazing tooling. I started rewriting in
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and never looked back.
